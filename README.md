**Description**: 🎧 **Personality-based Music Recommendation System** (based on REAL psychometrically validated personality measures, not some fluffy woo-woo astrological Buzzfeed quiz stuff! 🔮🤓) 

- **UPDATE**: This project was built a long time ago in a matter of 2-3 weeks as a beginner project. So, there are no doubt tons of errors and questionable stuff that could have been addressed better!  

- **Basic info**: 
Inspired by empirical research demonstrating the links between personality dimensions and music preferences, I created this app based on _collaborative filtering_ + _content-based filtering_ using **kNN** and **cosine similarities**. Specifically, this app recommends different types of music to users based on their: 
  1) Unique personality dimensions (as validated by the psychometrically valid **Big Five Inventory**) and
  2) Real-time in-app user interactions and behaviors (e.g., 👍🏻 or 👎🏻 to a sample song snippet).
