**Description**: Personality-based music recommendation system 

- **Basic info**: 
Inspired by empirical research demonstrating the links between personality dimensions and music preferences, I created this app based on collaborative filtering + content-based filtering using kNN and cosine similarities. Specifically, this app recommends different types of music to users based on their 1) unique personality dimensions (as validated by the psychometrically valid Big Five Inventory) and 2) in-app interaction and behaviors (e.g., 👍🏻 or 👎🏻 to a sample song snippet).
