Personality-based music recommendation system 

- Basic info: inspired by empirical research demonstrating the links between personality dimensions and music preferences, I created this app based on collaborative filtering + content-based filtering using kNN and cosine similarities. Specifically, this app recommends different types of music to users based on their 1) unique personality dimensions (Big Five) and 2) in-app interaction and behaviors (e.g., 👍🏻 or 👎 to a sample song snippet).
